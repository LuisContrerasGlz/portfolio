Responsive Portfolio.

This is my professional porfolio which contains my information and links to my different data such as my GitHub page, my Linkedin profile, my resume to view online or download if required, this information is contained on the home/index page.
On the Navbar and in the content of the page there are buttons to navigate to the projects page and credentials page.

On Projects page you will find my projects with their live demo link and also the repo to check the structure and the code, (currently working as template since projects will be added).

On the credentials page you will find all my professional certifications and courses where you can see some of my achievements.
(This page is also on works since the format is been checked for all the documents, coming soon)
All pages have working links to different sections and pages to make it a positive experience for the viewer to interact with it, as well as been Responsive which is good to make sure this ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
